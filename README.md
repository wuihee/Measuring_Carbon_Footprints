# Measuring Footprints
The objective of this project is to create an algorithm that efficiently and precisely measures the overall carbon footprint of a region, allowing for an accurate representation of the region’s impact on the environment. Instead of using a heavy-handed approach and trying to measure every single factor contributing to a region’s carbon footprint, the algorithm will aim to be more efficient in this aspect, by only measuring the key factors, which in the end, still accurately portray a region’s carbon footprint.

First, in the research phase, the current standards for measuring carbon footprints must be assessed, along with the causes of a carbon footprint. Next, the algorithm will create and then implemented into a Python script, allowing for quick and easy comparisons between regions. The city of Seattle and New York will be used as two examples. Finally, everything will be finalized and compiled into a physical infographic and a conclusion summarizing the whole project will be written. During the sustainability fair, the infographic, reports and a Jupyter notebook will be displayed.
